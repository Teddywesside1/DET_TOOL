# Det_Tool
## Target
-  This project is trying to abstract deep learning models and inference engines to help user better implement different models on multiple platforms with multiple inference engines, i.e. tensorrt, ncnn.
-  Currently, 2d detection model `yolov5` and tensorrt are implemented with pre/post-processing accelerated by `openmp`.
-  A `tensorrt` model quatilization tool is implemented.

## TODO
-  1. Implement `ncnn`.
   2. Implement other deep learning models.
